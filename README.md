# DiceGame
This repository contains the code for a simple dice game implemented in both Java and Python. The game involves throwing two dice and calculating the sum of the numbers that appear on the top faces of the dice.
# Game Rules
* Two dice are thrown at each turn.
* The numbers on the top faces of the dice after they land are added together.
* If the sum of these two numbers is 7, you win the game!
This game is a fun and educational way to practice programming concepts in both Java and Python. It also provides an interesting way to explore the probabilities involved in dice games. Enjoy!
